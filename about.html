                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in San Diego. When I was very young, my family moved to the Bay Area. We bounced around for a little bit near
                    Berkeley before settling in the small town of Martinez.

                    <p>
                        Martinez is actually the hometown of naturalist John Muir!

                <p>
                    Sometime in high school, I became interested in computer science, and in college, I was enamored with web development. 
                    I decided to pursue this as my career path!

                <h2>Skills and Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently a third-year Math-Computer Science major at UCSD. My skills currently encompass 
                    <em>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</em>, and also <em>React, Tailwind, and Next.js</em> (sorry <abbr>Prof.</abbr> Powell). Also, if you
                    ever need a qualified ice cream/dessert expert, I've worked at both Baskin-Robbins and Matcha Cafe Maiko.

                <h2>Interests</h2>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    I grew up playing the piano. I took lessons for a while but now I play every once in a while. Recently, I've been more 
                    interested in the acoustic guitar. I'm still an amateur, but I'm learning!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite artists according to my Spotify wrapped for 2024 are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
                    <li>Olivia Rodrigo</li>
                    <li>Kanye West</li>
                    <li>Laufey</li>
                    <li>Tyler, The Creator</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I love going to concerts and live events; in fact, I've already gone to see Laufey and I'm seeing Kendrick and Tyler
                    this year!
                </p>

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                    <p>
                        I play many video games, mostly on Xbox and Steam. Before, I've been into COD, Rocket League, Stardew Valley, and
                        Celeste, just to name a few. I'm especially into indie Steam games (webfishing my beloved). However, the one video 
                        game that's won my heart is Rivals of Aether 1 and 2. I have ~500 hours in the first game, and ~150 hours in the second.
                        I've gone to multiple tournaments for this game. If you play Rivals, hit me up!

                <h3>Sports</h3>
                    <h4>Baseball</h4>
                        <p>
                            Being a San Diego <del>native</del> <ins>transplant</ins>, I love the Padres. I love them a little <em>too</em> much.
                            I love them so much that I've spent a considerable amount of money on them throughout my life. During the season, whether 
                            they win or lose often decides if I have a good day or not. Even when I grew upin the Bay Area, I would root for my 
                            beautiful Padres. The 2022 and 2024 seasons will always live in my mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, I grew up playing baseball. I played starting as a child, but I quit in high school in favor of lacrosse and
                            cross country. Baseball has a special place in my heart.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Football</h4>
                        <p>
                            Contrary to other fans, I stayed a Chargers fan throughout their move to LA. Of course, I hated the fact that
                            they left,but I still was too invested to give in. I love Justin Herbert in particular.He's my role model, my muse. 
                            If there's one million Justin Herbert fans on Earth, I'm one of them. If there's one Justin Herbert fan, then it's me. 
                            If there are none, then I'm dead. Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Herbert... honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you 
                            ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you drive into the endzone and strike fear into your enemies eyes. 
                            Your silky smooth touch passes, and that gorgeous spiral. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze 
                            time so I would never have to watch you retire. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great man and friend.
                            I forever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only 
                            thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. 
                            I remember when you lost your first playoff game and its like my heart got broken into a million 
                            pieces. 2022 was a hard year for us baby, but I know you'll bounce back. Not only have you changed the 
                            game of football and the world forever, but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older, 
                            but still the goat, my goat. I love you pookie bear, my glorious king, Justin Herbert. &lt;3

                        So my family is from the Philippines. Specifically, my mom is from Cebu and so is my Dad's side of the family.
                        Despite this, I learned very minimal Bisaya growing up. Lately, it's become my mission to learn and speak with
                        my family. I've borrowed Bisaya library books, listened to Bisaya music, annoyed my mom with constant syntax
                        questions, talked to ChatGPT in Bisaya, joined the Filipino org on campus to find people who spoke, among 
                        many other things. So <strong>please</strong>, if you know Bisaya, send me a message. I need a partner to learn with.
